    </h1>
    <p>
      NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is a powerful rocket that provides the
      foundation to allow humans and cargo to travel beyond low-Earth orbit
      and eventually to the Moon, Mars and beyond. SLS is designed to be the
      most capable and advanced launch vehicle ever built, with a maximum lift
      capacity of over 90 metric tons. This next-generation rocket system
      utilizes a combination of solid and liquid propulsion stages to provide
      a safe, reliable and efficient means of access to deep space. The SLS is
      designed to be flexible, scalable and sustainable, meaning it can be
      configured for a variety of missions with different capabilities,
      depending on the needs of the mission. It is also designed to be
      reusable, reducing the cost of future missions and making space travel
      more accessible. With its unparalleled power and versatility, SLS will
      not only pave the way for NASA's continued space exploration, but also
      for you as you journey into space with Astrosphere.

      <p>• Each launch of the SLS costs over 2 billion dollars!</p>
      <p>
        • The SLS has the greatest liftoff thrust of any rocket in operation!

      Protection : <span class="blueGradientText">The EVA Space Suit</span>
    </h1>
    <p>
      Extra-Vehicular Activity(EVA) Suits work to protect astronauts from the
      harsh conditions of space, including temperatures ranging from -250 to
      250 degrees Fahrenheit, high-energy radiation, debris, and more.
      According to NASA, our partner organization, space suits consist of 7
      distinct elements: the cooling garment and other flexible layers, the
      hard upper torso(HUT), the gloves, the lower torso, the portable life
      support system(PLSS), the communications cap, and the helmet. The
      cooling garment is the first layer of the spacesuit. The spandex layer
      is covered with tubes of cool water, which regulate the astronaut's
      temperature. On top of the cooling garment, EVA suits can include up to
      16 different layers to hold oxygen, maintain a habitable pressure,
      shield from dust, and other functions. The HUT is a durable, lightweight
      shell that links the functions of the PLSS to the inside of the space
      suit and provides openings for the rest of the suit to attach to. The
      gloves of the EVA suit provide protection and temperature regulation to
      the fingers. The pants and boots of the EVA suit keep the legs and feet
      protected and warm while the waist provides attachment points for
      tethers and other tools. The PLSS, typically worn as a backpack on the
      back of the EVA suits, is a group of systems that work together to
      maintain an optimal environment for the astronaut within the space suit
      through regulating pressuring, filtering oxygen, and monitoring vitals.
      The communicational cap, often called the Snoopy cap, holds the
      astronaut’s earphones and microphones and connects to the spacesuit's
      radio. Through the cap, astronauts can communicate with each other and
      mission control. Finally, the helmet is formed of a plastic bubble, a
      protective visor, and the sun visor and shades. The intricate elements
      of the helmet help maintain the pressure and oxygen levels of the suit
      and protect against the sun’s intense rays. With the help of our EVA
      suits, we here at Astrosphere do everything to make sure your future
      adventures are filled with excitement and safety.

        • Your hands are the most sensitive part of your body to the cold
        temperatures of space. Gloves are important!

      <p>
        • Space suits may have red or white stripes to make it easier to see
        the astronauts.
